Import the WordCount component into your main app component and render it.



Here is some sample code that demonstrates the basic structure of a word count React app:


In this example, the WordCount component renders a text input field and a button that, when clicked, calls the countWords function to count the number of words in the input text. The word count is displayed below the input field. The App component simply renders the WordCount component.
